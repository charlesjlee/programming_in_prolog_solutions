This repo contains solutions to the exercises in the book [Programming in Prolog (5th edition)](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-642-55481-0) by Clocksin and Mellish (C&M).

The book contains 23 exercises but only includes solutions for 5 of them in Appendix A. For completeness, those 5 solutions are duplicated here with modification to address typos and compiler warnings. Solutions are based on SWI-Prolog v8.1.28.

Pull requests are welcome.
